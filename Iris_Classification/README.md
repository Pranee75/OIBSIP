# Iris Classification Project

This project uses the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using machine learning models.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can accurately classify iris flowers based on their physical measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). 
It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different ML algorithms.

## Files
- `Iris_Classification.ipynb` : Jupyter notebook with full code and analysis
- `dataset/Iris.csv` : Dataset used for training/testing

## Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree)

## Models Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Results
All models achieve high accuracy (>96%) on the Iris dataset.  
- KNN Accuracy: ~98%  
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: ~97%  
- Decision Tree Accuracy: ~98%  

## How to Run
1. Open `Iris_Classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells from start to finish.
